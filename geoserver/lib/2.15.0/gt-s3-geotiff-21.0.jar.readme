This is gt-s3-getotiff-21-SNAPHOT meant to
replace gt-s3-geotiff-21.0.jar in 
geoserver/WEB-INF/lib, with fixes
that didn't make it to the official 21.0 
GeoTools release from Tue Feb 2019, whilst
the patch is from Mon Mar 2019 at commit
c73b886b1, and hence will be available in
the next 21.1 GeoTools release.
